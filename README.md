# learncpp
Walking through a thorough guide of C++ to get some experience of System-Level-coding

Help links:
If configuration and Intellisense: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux#_cc-configurations

If problems with compiling:
check G++ standard by adding some tails to the commands:
g++ "standard version" namefile.cpp/namefile.cc/etc

Notable version:
"-std=c++11", "-std=c++14", "-std=c++17", or "-std=c++20" to enable C++11/14/17/20 support respectively
"-std=c++2a" for C++20 support instead if you have GCC 8 or 9
